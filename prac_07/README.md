## About me
My Name is Joey Vella and I am a 2nd year electrical engineering student at JCU. Here are some key lessons I have learnt so far from CP1404:

- Writing readable and consistent code using meaningful name and indentation and docstrings.
- Writing code that is efficient using trait such as EAFF and LBYL approaches 
- Learning to use GitHub to track and manage changes and to also recieve peer reviews.
